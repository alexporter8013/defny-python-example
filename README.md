# lorrel-py

Example project for integrating Dafny into a Python project.

## Namesake

Dafny is reminiscent of the Greek mythological figure Daphne. In Greek
mythology, Daphne transforms into a Laurel tree. Just as Dafny is reminiscent
of Daphne, Lorrel is reminiscent of Laurel, since this projects demonstrating
turning Dafny into something else.

## Structure

With this project, I want to capture the "current" implementation path versus
the "idea" implementation path. To that end, the `main` branch shall contain
the working implementation which reflects the current best practices. The
`ideal` branch shall contain the "ideal" implementation model for integrating
Dafny into larger projects.

## Contributions

Please feel free to open PRs against this repository for either the `main` or
`ideal` branches per the above description of each. For issues/discussion,
please refer to and comment on
[#5206](https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/issues/5206).
